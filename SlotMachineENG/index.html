  <p>The aim is to align the three LEDs that “go down” on the same line. Button A is used to make
    start the game, button B is used to reset the game after a game and therefore be able to play a new one

        microbit, i.e. a light that travels down a column from top to bottom.
        In this case the column used is the leftmost one, corresponding to the spatial variable x always at 0;
        placing a plot-unplot pair, a for loop that covers the 5 interested positions and a pause that regulates me
        the speed of movement, I get what we set ourselves. Inside a forever I'm going to repeat
        this cycle forever.
        For the other two columns (x=2 and x=4), I repeat the same process since all loops forever of the same
        program are all processed together.

        indenting time1,time2 and time3 in the OnStart. As for the value (ms), not wanting to sound like too much
        arbitrary, we left the matter to chance, making use of the appropriate mathematical operators.<br></br></td>

        the flow of our dots until they stop, otherwise we would see them flowing "from here to eternity", for
        put it James Jones. Let's proceed step by step: first of all let's slow down the dot, let's take la as an example
        column x=0, resetting the pause time at each cycle by adding a little; time1 equal to itself
        plus a small random value, in order to further deviate from deterministic methods and give variability

      <td style=width:50%;height:250px;>Now we have to stop the cycle at a precise point. Who decides it? There
        The answer varies according to the solution I want to adopt and the archetype of structure I have created so far. In
        In this case I find it convenient to work on the pause time by establishing that once a certain amount has been exceeded (ascribed
        in an if with a comparison operator) the powerful break function "kicks" me out of the loop. Foresight is
        draw the last dot corresponding to the y set by index and place it ABSOLUTELY before break,
        worth the loss of the dot. The whole function is indented in a further if, with the comparison operation of
        inverse sign,, to avoid rewriting the dot in the position x=0;y=0. Similar work needs to be done too
        for code blocks related to columns x=2 and x=4,<b>trying with the MakeCode simulator it should go back to it

      <td style=width:50%;height:260px;>Done? Ready for the final rush? Well.
        Only one thing is missing, to make my microbit realize that if my three stop me on any line
        dots must tell me that I won. The request would seem quite simple, but in reality it hides a
        sneaky detail that only knowledge of how the microbit operates can elude. We easily come to
        understand to compare the spatial coordinates of the three dots relative to the columns, well, them
        coincide with the index word, representing a progressive number and repeated several times in the for loops
        "cadenza" the gait. It is the same for all three cycles, therefore, if this were the only problem, it would be enough
        make three nominal ones per column and proceed with the comparison. But they denote the nature of variable ONLY inside
        of the for loop and, when the break function carries out, their value is always reset to 0, so,
        the equalities would always be verified.

      <td style=width:50%;height:260px;>Still taking the column x=0 for example, let's do something very simple,
        we define a new variable inside the for loop, call it y1, and set it to the value indicated by
        index, so that when the coveted moment of the break arrives, the value y is extrapolated without being
        reset. Let's mirror the related remaining blocks of code and proceed to the comparison.
